## Content Calendar - Week 1

### Monday

**LinkedIn:**
```
🤖 Hot take: AI won't replace your job.

But someone using AI will.

I've watched businesses transform in the past 6 months:

→ One agency owner went from 60-hour weeks to 35 hours
→ A SaaS company 3x'd their lead pipeline without hiring
→ An e-commerce brand automated 80% of customer support

The common thread? They stopped asking "Will AI work for us?"

They started asking "Which processes should AI handle first?"

The winners in 2024 aren't the biggest companies.
They're the fastest adapters.

What's one task you'd automate if you could? 👇

The businesses crushing it in 2024 have one thing in common:

They stopped asking "Will AI work for us?"

They started asking "What should AI handle first?"

The winners aren't the biggest.
They're the fastest adapters.

### Tuesday

**LinkedIn:**
```
📊 Real numbers from a real client:

BEFORE AI automation:
• 8-10 sales calls/week
• 20% were qualified
• 60+ hours worked weekly
• Revenue: $45K/month

AFTER AI automation (90 days):
• 8-10 sales calls/week
• 85% were qualified
• 40 hours worked weekly
• Revenue: $127K/month

Same number of calls.
Completely different results.

The AI doesn't make more calls.
It makes every call count.

DM me "QUALIFIED" if you want the breakdown.

#SalesAutomation #AIAgents #BusinessResults
```

**Twitter:**
```
My client went from $45K to $127K/month in 90 days.

Same number of sales calls.

The difference?

Every call was qualified before it happened.

AI handled the filtering. Humans handled the closing.

That's the future of sales.
```

### Wednesday

**LinkedIn:**
```
The anatomy of an AI Sales Agent that actually works:

1️⃣ PERSONALITY
Not robotic. Conversational. Asks great questions.

2️⃣ QUALIFICATION
BANT framework built in. Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline.

3️⃣ ROUTING
• Hot leads → Immediate Slack alert
• Warm leads → Email sequence
• Cold leads → Resource library

4️⃣ INTEGRATION
CRM sync. Calendar booking. Full conversation logging.

5️⃣ LEARNING
Gets smarter from every interaction. Improves weekly.

This isn't science fiction.
We've deployed 50+ of these in the past 6 months.

Average ROI payback? 23 days.

Save this post for when you're ready to scale. 🔖

### Thursday

**LinkedIn:**
```
Stop hiring SDRs to send templates.

I know that sounds harsh, but hear me out.

The average SDR:
- Costs $60-80K/year (salary + benefits)
- Takes 3-6 months to ramp up
- Works 40 hours/week max
- Handles ~50 conversations/day
- Has good days and bad days

An AI Sales Agent:
- Costs $5K setup + $200/month
- Is productive in 1 week
- Works 24/7/365
- Handles 500+ conversations/day
- Consistent performance every time

This doesn't mean "fire your sales team."

It means: Let AI handle volume. Let humans handle value.

Your best salespeople should be closing, not qualifying.

Agree? Disagree? Let's discuss. 👇

#SalesStrategy #AIvsSaaS #FutureOfWork
```

**Twitter:**
```
Your best salespeople should be closing, not qualifying.

Let AI handle the volume.
Let humans handle the value.

This isn't about replacement.
It's about elevation.
