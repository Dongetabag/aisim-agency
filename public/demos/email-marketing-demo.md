## Template 2: Value Email (Day 1)

**Subject:** The $65K mistake most business owners make
**Preview:** (And the $5K solution that fixes it)

---

```html
Hi {{first_name}},

Let me tell you about the most expensive mistake I see business
owners make:

Hiring humans for robot work.

I'm not anti-hiring. Building a great team is crucial.

But here's what happens:

You hire an SDR for $65K/year to send templated emails, make cold
calls, and qualify leads. They're talented. They work hard.

But 70% of their time is spent on repetitive tasks ANY AI could
handle.

That's $45,500/year in robot work being done by a human.

---

THE FLIP:

What if that SDR only talked to qualified prospects?

What if every conversation was with someone who:
• Has budget
• Has authority to buy
• Has a real need
• Has urgency

That's what AI qualification does.

One of our clients made this switch:

BEFORE: 8-10 sales calls/week, 20% qualified, $45K/month revenue
AFTER: 8-10 sales calls/week, 85% qualified, $127K/month revenue

Same number of calls. Completely different results.

---

ACTION STEP:

Audit your team's time this week.

Ask: "How much time is spent on tasks a computer could do?"

My guess: It's higher than you think.

Reply with your number - I'd love to hear what you find.

Talk tomorrow,
Alex

P.S. - If you want to see exactly how this works, I have 3 strategy
call slots open this week. [Book yours here →]

## Template 3: Case Study Email (Day 3)

**Subject:** How Sarah's agency 3x'd revenue (without hiring)
**Preview:** Her automation stack is surprisingly simple

---

```html
Hi {{first_name}},

Quick story for you today.

Sarah runs a digital marketing agency. 15 clients, 4 employees,
constantly overwhelmed.

Her biggest problem? Lead follow-up.

She was getting 100-150 leads per week from her website. But by the
time her team followed up (usually 24-48 hours), most had gone cold
or found someone else.

Sound familiar?

---

THE TRANSFORMATION:

We built Sarah an AI-powered lead response system:

STEP 1: Instant Response
When a lead submits a form, AI responds in <30 seconds with a
personalized message based on their inquiry.

STEP 2: Qualification
The AI asks 4 key questions to determine fit:
- What's your current marketing budget?
- What services are you interested in?
- When are you looking to start?
- What's your biggest marketing challenge?

STEP 3: Routing
- Hot leads → Immediate calendar booking
- Warm leads → Nurture email sequence
- Cold leads → Educational content

STEP 4: Handoff
Qualified meetings appear on Sarah's calendar with full context.
She walks in knowing exactly what they need.

---

THE RESULTS (90 days):

• Response time: 24 hours → 30 seconds
• Lead conversion: 8% → 23%
• Revenue: $52K/month → $156K/month
• Working hours: 60/week → 45/week

ROI on the automation setup: 3,100%

---

Sarah's system.

## Template 4: Objection Handling (Day 5)

**Subject:** "AI sounds great, but..." (let me address that)
**Preview:** The 4 concerns I hear most often

---

```html
Hi {{first_name}},

Over the past 3 years, I've talked to hundreds of business owners
about AI automation.

Most are excited. But everyone has concerns.

Let me address the 4 I hear most often:

---

CONCERN #1: "It's too expensive"

The question isn't "How much does it cost?"

It's "What does NOT having it cost?"

• How many leads are going cold because follow-up is slow?
• How many hours does your team spend on repetitive tasks?
• What would 10 extra hours per week be worth?

Our average client sees ROI within 23 days.

---

CONCERN #2: "It won't sound human enough"

Modern AI doesn't sound like a robot.

It has personality. It asks follow-up questions. It picks up on
context.

Most people can't tell they're talking to AI until we tell them.

(And by then, they're already booked on your calendar.)

---

CONCERN #3: "My business is different"

You're right - every business is unique.

That's why we don't use templates. Every AI agent is custom-trained
on YOUR business, YOUR voice, YOUR customers.

We've deployed in 30+ industries. The underlying principles work
everywhere.

---

CONCERN #4: "I don't have time to set this up"

That's exactly why you need it.

But also: we do everything for you.

Your time investment: 1 hour onboarding call + occasional feedback.

Our time investment: Building, training, testing, deploying, and
optimizing your entire system.

---

Still have concerns? Reply to this email. I'll give you an honest
answer (even if that answer is "AI isn't right for you yet").

Talk soon,
Alex

P.S. - The best way to see if AI works for your business is a quick
strategy call. No pitch, just a roadmap. [Book a call →]

## Template 5: Call to Action (Day 7)

**Subject:** Ready when you are
**Preview:** Here's what happens when we talk

---

```html
Hi {{first_name}},

You've been with me for a week now.

You've seen the case studies. You've heard the numbers. You've
learned how AI automation actually works.

Now the question is: Are you ready to do something about it?

---

HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS ON A STRATEGY CALL:

Duration: 30 minutes
Cost: Free
Pressure: Zero

We'll cover:

✅ Your current situation
Where you are now. What's working. What's not.

✅ Your goals
Where you want to be. Revenue. Time. Freedom.

✅ Your roadmap
Which automations would have the biggest impact for YOUR specific
business.

✅ Your timeline
Realistic expectations for implementation and results.

By the end, you'll have a clear action plan - whether you work with
us or not.

---

WHY NOW?

Honestly? The longer you wait, the further behind you fall.

Your competitors are already implementing AI.

Not because it's trendy. Because it works.

Every month you wait is:
- Leads going cold
- Time being wasted
- Revenue being left on the table
